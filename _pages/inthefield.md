One of the things that I really love about herpetological research is that you get to travel around the world to look for these amazing animals in their natural habitats. As a herpetologist, I also believe strongly in the importance of having good "field knowledge" of our study organisms that can only be gained from the time spent in the field. Below are some of the highlights from my fieldwork and herping trips.
