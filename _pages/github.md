<span style="font-size: 12pt;"> __Below are my GitHub repos associated with ongoing projects, workshops, recently published studies, and software packages__ </span>

[Gloydius genome assembly](https://github.com/yucheols/Gloydius_ussuriensis_genome_assembly){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> An ongoing project on PacBio HiFi whole-genome assembly of the Ussuri Pitviper (*Gloydius ussuriensis*). </span>

[Salamander ENMs](https://github.com/yucheols/TwoSalDist){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> My undergrad thesis research that turned into a deep-dive into the behaviors of ecological niche models and niche overlap analyses under different baseline climatic data and model parameterization. </span>

[DPRK Gloydius](https://github.com/yucheols/DPRK_Gloydius){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> R scripts used for niche modeling and multivariate morphological analyses of *Gloydius* specimens from northeast Asia. </span>

[Nonnative Lycodon](https://github.com/yucheols/Lycodon_ENM_ver2){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> In this study, we used phylogenetic analyses of two mitochondrial genes to trace the geographic origin of a non-native Red-banded Snake (*Lycodon rufozonatus*) found on Jeju Island, South Korea. On the mainland South Korea, *L. rufozonatus* is a commonly found species. But it is well-known to be absent from Jeju. Our results show that this particular individual was translocated from somewhere in China. We also used ecological niche modeling to assess the establishment potential of this species within Jeju. This repo contains the code for running the models. </span>


[Nonnative Geckos](https://github.com/yucheols/Gekko){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> This repo is for a paper I did with collaborators from Kangwon National University Herp Lab and the National Institute of Ecology in South Korea. Here, we looked at establishment potentials of two gecko species introduced to South Korea (*Gekko japonicus* and *G. swinhonis*). We generated ecological niche models for the two species to map out their potential suitable habitats in South Korea, both under the current and future environmental conditions. In addition, we quantified and compared their niches to investigate whether their nonnative sympatry in some regions in South Korea is driven by shared ecological requirements. This repo contains the codes for niche modeling and niche analyses.</span>


[ENMwrap](https://github.com/yucheols/ENMwrap){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> This is an R package that I started to develop recently. It is essentially a collection of custom functions that I've wrote to run models for my senior research thesis. This package utilizes existing R packages for running MaxEnt ecological niche models (ENMs), with options to test multiple species and background datasets. It also includes other miscellaneous functions to help with data formatting, plotting, etc. __Currently under development.__ </span>


[ENMs in R](https://github.com/yucheols/ENMs_In_R){: .btn .btn--info .text-center}

<span style="font-size: 13pt;"> This repo is for a workshop that I led at the Lab of Dr. Amaël Borzée (Nanjing Forestry University, China) in February 2024. </span>
